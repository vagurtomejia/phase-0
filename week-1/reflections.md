#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

**what I have learned?**
-the Pomodoro technique. I like the idea most of all because it seems to be a simple way for maintaining the focus (I have a problem with that)
-the importance of protecting myself of external interactions
-the habit of integrating a recap after a task/release/sprint. ItÂ´s very usefull to evaluate what I working fine and what I can improve
-the idea of begining "small" when I want to do something or integrate a new habit. 
what is time-boxing and how can I use it?
Time-boxing is fixing a task/goal/objectif and fixing a limited time for doing it and after this fixed time stop even if the goal is not achieved and review.
I think I am going to use it all the time on Phase 0: for pear-pearing sessions and GPS but also for my personal work at DBC and outside and my personal goals (see next item for more details).

**What I am currently doing and is it working?**
-I have an Agile-inspired way of listing the task I need/want to do. I use the Trello tool for a visual support. I divide my tasks into 4 boxes: sandbox, icebox, "backlog" and "sprint". My sprints duration is 1 week.
-I  also have a week-timetable (Excel) which integrates health, work and family time
The Trello works pretty well but what I need to improve is that I have to learn to estimate the time I am going to need for accomplishing a goal more accuratly. I saw this point specifically is part of the Pomodoro technique, so I purshased a Pomodoro book and I will try to learn more about it.
Also what is not working is the contingency management. When I have a big unexpected that comes, I loose control on y schedules.

**What is my plan for Phase 0 and how to emply what I have learned?**
I will integrate my new learnings by iterations in order to test if the changes work:
My first iteration will be next week (week2) and will include :
-keep my existing Trello backlog
-keep my existing week-timetable
-split my existing Trello "backlog" into 25 minutes tasks
-focus on one task at a time, review and then take a 5 minutes break
-avoid all interruptions during the 25 timebox
-talking to my family and explain them my new organisation in order for them to understand and not feel rejected
-review my new management technique after week 2 and try to improve what needs to be improved
-repeat an iteration every week untill I feel satisfied whith my new time management technique






#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1-What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a macro processor that executes commands.
Bash is the shell for GNU
2-What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
-This material was really time consuming for me. It took me more than 5 hours to accomplish the release.
3-Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
yes
4-In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
the commands used for the compilation of the files and generation of the executables. In this case "ruby" for Ruby and "cc" for C.
5-Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd displays the path of the current directory
-ls displays a list of the files and the directories in the present directory
-mv moves a file to another directory
-cd change the directory
-../ goes to the root
-touch creates a 0-byte file
-mkdir creates a directory
-less pager that displays the content of a file page by page
-rmdir deletes a directory
-rm deletes a file
-help I do not know on the top of my head. Maybe the same thing than "man"?
