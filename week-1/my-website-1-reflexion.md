Open source is a computer program in which the source code is available to the public for use, modification and distribution.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
I think the Open Source movement is an example for all the people. In our society we are taught to compete and to be selfish. The Open Source brings a tottaly new paradigm based on collaboration, sharing and working for the common good.

When we use a licence whe explicitly choose a way of sharing and protecting our work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It was very usefull for me to repeat once again the complete workflow for making changes to a repository. No aha moments this time :) No struggles neither.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I didnÂ´t look for other ressources sadly. I'm already way behind on my week work.
